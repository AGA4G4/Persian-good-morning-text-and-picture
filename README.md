# Persian-good-morning-text-and-picture
This python code is written for the greetings at the start of each day.
Works with FastAPI and the function is: gives the results of the picture and the text both in a json file and you can also use them separately
I wrote this for the use of automation with the help of n8n and accordingly I put the "requirements.txt" and "Dockerfile" for this very purpose.
before using make sure that it works with Swagger because sometimes I ran to problems with it.
